                      I didn't complete my degree largely because I thought most of my time was spent on other topics
                      that didn't interest me.
                      When I could be spending that time on learning what I actually love doing, and that is code. I
                      really spent time alone studying a lot, learned more from researching it myself than I ever did
                      from school.
